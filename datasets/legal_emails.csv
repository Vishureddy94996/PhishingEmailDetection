According to Edmund Cooper and Tana Jones, the London office is deciding whether European counterparties should be permitted to trade U.S. power products via EOL.  I believe that this allocation of counterparty review responsibility (with regard to power products) should be reversed.  The legal team for U.S. power is in the best position to determine whether a counterparty, domestic or European, has the requisite legal authority to trade U.S. power, and I believe that the London office is better positioned to determine whether a counterparty, U.S. or other, has the requisite authority to trade a European power product.As we have discussed during the last week, a counterparty must have specific federal regulatory authorization in order to trade U.S. power.  I cannot identify any foreign counterparties from my lists of federally authorized entities and think it highly unlikely that a foreign counterparty will have the necessary authority to trade U.S. power.  Jim Fallon has expressly instructed me that in the event we do not currently trade U.S. power with a counterparty and cannot otherwise confirm that a specific counterparty possesses regulatory approval to trade power, a counterparty should NOT be permitted to trade U.S. power via EOL.  Accordingly, I return to my initial position that except for those foreign counterparties with whom we are currently trading over-the-counter (if any), all foreign counterparties should be granted read-only access to U.S. power products.  In the event a specific counterparty requests access to U.S. power trading, we can examine whether that specific party possesses the necessary authority to trade power.  Edmund Cooper and Justin Boyd are reviewing whether a similar bar should apply to the trading of European power by U.S. counterparties, and I will defer to their judgment on that issue.Please call me at *36121 with any questions or comments.Regards,Leslie Hansen"leslie.hansen@enron.com,tana.jones@enron.com,"Fri, 27 Oct 2000 03:20:00 -0700 (PDT)",3:20:00,Re: EOL Credit Responses 10/26/00,,"LTV Steel Company Inc. is not authorized to trade US power -- restricted by credit.*************************Oklahoma Gas and Electric is authorized to trade US power, but only pursuant to the on-line GTCs.

Net margining between the two benchmark crudes and an aggressive program to reduce other trading costs will benefit our customers, members, and the marketplace as a whole.  Being offered on the New York Mercantile Exchange will enhance this market through absolute neutrality and our demonstrated liquidity and expertise in creating efficient energy markets.For more information, please call Robert Levin, Senior Vice President of Planning and Development at (212) 299-2390, or Daniel Brusstar, Director of Energy Research, at (212) 299-2604.__________________________________________________Please click on the link below to indicate you have received thisemail.""http://208.206.41.61/email/email_log.cfm?useremail=tana.jones@enron.com&refdoc=(01-128)""Note: If you click on the above line and nothing happens, please copythe text between the quotes, open your internet browser,paste it into the web site address and press Return."david.minns@enron.com,tana.jones@enron.com,"Wed, 19 Apr 2000 01:26:00 -0700 (PDT)",1:26:00,Re: EOL Credit Responses 4/17,,"	paul.quilkey@enron.comMime-Version: 1.0Content-Type: text/plain; charset=us-asciiContent-Transfer-Encoding: 7bitBcc: paul.smith@enron.com, allan.ford@enron.com, shari.wicks@enron.com, 	paul.quilkey@enron.comX-From: David MinnsX-To: Tana JonesX-cc: Paul Smith, Allan Ford, Shari Wicks, Paul QuilkeyX-bcc: X-Folder: \Tanya_Jones_Dec2000\Notes Folders\Online tradingX-Origin: JONES-TX-FileName: tjones.nsfConfirming CS Energy Limited are cleared to trade Australian power.

We will assign all future limits by using one-tenth of the assigned credit limit since using the Sigma factor in these calculations generates a value of roughly one-tenth of the full limit.

I do have a college friend out there (who I hope tolocate) so you might not have to be stuck with me. :)Anyhow I'm Nikki.  I'd go more into depth but everytime I write it out itsounds more like a personal add then an introduction!Brendan tells me you are about to close on a condo.  Congratulations!  Ican't wait to have a place of my own!  Apartment life is horrible.  Myneighbor and I knock on the bathroom wall at each other in the mornings justto say ""hi"".  I'm really serious.  I actually have really great neighbors inmy building and I have to admit, apartment life is a good way to get to knowpeople.I don't know what Brendan has told you about me but here's the story.  I wasborn and raised in New Mexico and hate it here!  I need trees and green!Someone once compared landing in New Mexico to landing in a litter box.Where there's not dirt there's piles of crap.  Now everytime a plane fliesme back home I look around and agree.So, to say the least I'm a little stir crazy for a new environment.  Thefirst part of August I will be moving to Newport Beach, California.  Or oneof four other beach communities in that area.  I want to experience thatwhole lifestyle for at least a year.  Then I'm moving to Oregon.  I've nevervisited or anything I'm just drawn there.  To be perfectly honest it'sbecause of the two movies ""Goonies"" and ""Kindergarten Cop"".  I loved thosemovies as a kid and have wanted to move to Astoria ever since.  Now's mychance.  I just finished college and have a period of resting time before Igo after my master's in Public Health Administration or my MBA.  We'll seewhich fits me best later.  I don't feel that at 24 I can really decide the""best"" avenue for the next 50 years of my career so I'm waiting for the lifeexperience to kick in and lead the way later.As of yet I have no set plans as to dates, iteneraries, etc and so forth.I'm a very spontaneous type of person I don't really ""do"" planning andscheduling.  I just kind of show up and try to make my own fun.  It's betterthat way.  Life can be too organized!Well now that I've given you a ""short"" introduction...haha.  I'd love tohear back from you about any conflicting dates that you might have in July.Don't worry if they change I won't hold ya to them.  The only time that I amforecasting for myself is the 12th through the 16th (of July) IF I don't goto Calgary, Canada.  Currently I'm planning as many trips as I possibly can.My youth is fading fast and I need to enjoy as much of it as I possiblewhile I don't have a husband and kids to take care of. :)Hope to hear from you soon!Nikki_______________________________________________________Send a cool gift with your E-Cardhttp://www.bluemountain.com/giftcenter/"bill.williams@enron.com,"monika.causholli@enron.com, craig.dean@enron.com, mohamed.elafandi@enron.com, ","Thu, 3 May 2001 12:58:09 -0700 (PDT)",12:58:09,,,"	mark.guzman@enron.com, leaf.harasin@enron.com, 	steven.merris@enron.com, bert.meyers@enron.com, v..porter@enron.com, 	ryan.slinger@enron.com, geir.solberg@enron.com, kate.symes@enron.com, 	bill.williams@enron.comSubject: Short for 05/04-05/05Mime-Version: 1.0Content-Type: text/plain; charset=us-asciiContent-Transfer-Encoding: 7bitX-From: Williams III, Bill </O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=BWILLIA5>X-To: Causholli, Monika </O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=Mcaushol>, Dean, Craig </O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=Notesaddr/cn=81b9e43d-fa8ad924-86256a0d-76e28f>, Elafandi, Mohamed </O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=Notesaddr/cn=20957f53-a1d19cb1-86256a31-704dc5>, Guzman, Mark </O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=Mguzman3>, Harasin, Leaf </O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=Lharasin>, Merris, Steven </O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=Smerris>, Meyers, Bert </O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=Bmeyers>, Porter, David V. </O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=Dporter3>, Slinger, Ryan </O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=Rslinger>, Solberg, Geir </O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=Gsolber>, Symes, Kate </O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=Ksymes>, Williams III, Bill </O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=Bwillia5>X-cc: X-bcc: X-Folder: \ExMerge - Williams III, Bill\BillX-Origin: WILLIAMS-W3X-FileName: Group.We are short 25 mws under ST-WBOM in NP-15 for HE 7-22 on FRIDAY and SATURDAY(05/04 and 05/05 respectively).

I have been missing you like crazy without any way of getting in touch with you.  How are things going?  We have so much catching up to do.  I realize more than ever what a special friend you are and how much I have missed our conversations.  I hope all is going wonderful with you.  Things here are great.  I am almost done with my second year of school (only 2 more weeks)  I just took a comprehensive exam over the last 2 years and I think I passed.  I am constantly amazed that I am almost done with school and will soon be practicing medicine on poor innocent people.  I'll actually be in Seattle all of August and September, so hopefully we can arrange some kind of meeting so I can give you a big hug.How is work?  Are you still doing the same job?  I know last time we talked you had all kinds of crazy ideas floating around about moving to Europe or Japan or something crazy like that.  In fact, that is what I thought had happened and I was so scared that i would not be able to find you.  Do you still have your wonderful motorcycle?  I know you were moving to a new home the last time we talked, but I know nothing about it.  are you living by yourself, in a condo, a home, an apartment?  Anything else wild and crazy that I have missed hearing about?  I'm sure there is....Well, I just had to check something quickly off the internet before class today, and unfortunately I must go.  But it was wonderful to see your name and hear that you are alive and well.  I will definately be calling you this week to catch up.I have missed you my friend, take care,SaraGet your FREE download of MSN Explorer at http://explorer.msn.com "morganize@yahoo.com,bill.williams.iii@enron.com,"Tue, 24 Apr 2001 21:45:00 -0700 (PDT)",21:45:00,Coachella,http://auctions.yahoo.com/,"Bill,Want to make sure this is your email first.Morgan__________________________________________________Do You Yahoo!?Yahoo!

The bottom of the El Paso model is divided into five different regions.  Prescheduled sales, real time sales, then prescheduled purchases, real time purchases and finally ancillary services.  Each group of purchases, sales and ancillary services need to be seperate.  The purchases and sales should each pull in to the summary portion at the bottom of the model.  Likewise the ancillary services should pull into the blue ancillary service summary section.  Kathy at El Paso and/or those on shift the next day are having to correct mistakes with these formulas.  As always, if you have questions regarding the El Paso model, please ask a more experienced member of the group or myself.  Otherwise, mistakes on simple formulas should be expected not to happen.Thanks,Bill"jason.meeker@nike.com,bill.williams.iii@enron.com,"Mon, 23 Apr 2001 23:03:00 -0700 (PDT)",23:03:00,Soccer Test,,"Hello Bill,Just a reminder that we scheduled the test for Thursday May 3rd @ 1:00.Just bring some clothes to test in, and we have places to change here.Directions -Go West on 26 to Murry Rd.

Based upon current gas prices and current index averages, in addition to a significant increase in market loads for the balance of the month, it is likely Transco will experience significant negative imbalances.Transco reminds its customers and shippers that, according to Section 5.2 of Rate Schedules FT and IT, they ""?have the responsibility to adjust and maintain a concurrent balance between receipts and deliveries?"".  Transco expects all parties to adhere to this requirement to ensure that there will be no loss in Transco's operational flexibility.  Transco will closely monitor system conditions and, if shippers and customers do create significant negative imbalances, Transco may be required to initiate restrictive practices at its pooling points and disallow make-up transportation.  If you have any questions, please call Terry Fitch at (713) 215-3361 or John McGrath at (713) 215-2514.Terry C.

The comment about hedgeing JCC with Brent is right on if the exercise is to hedge our own LNG positions that we have tieds to JCC. Note that the high JCC correlation to Prompt Brent is not something that is obvious to non-Enron LNG-tied-to-JCC buyers. If you are an LNG-tied-to-JCC buyer, and you wish to hedge your purchases, wouldn't you want to be able to transact ona a JCC contract? My objective is to have a JCC contract on EOL, whereby we, Enron, take the JCC/Brent risk (which is why we asked Vince Kaminski's group to study the relationship and give us a hedge ratio to use). I'm attaching a model used to calculate JCC for Dabhol Power Co.'s Adgas and Oman LNG contracts. Basically what happens is that all the ""raw oil"" volumes imported into Japan and added up and the total price is divide by the total volume, and there is a Yen/US$ foreighn exchange component as well. That is JCC. It was designed by the Japanese so that they could tie their LNG imports to their average price of crude imports whereby the LNG would be cheaper on an MMBTU basis.Comments?Brgds,MarcChris Glaas10/13/2000 03:11 AMTo: Marc De La Roche/HOU/ECT@ECTcc:  Subject: Re: Japanese Crude Cocktail & Prompt Brent  Marcregarding putting JCC on EOL I get a negative respons from our Sing office. It is not a very liquid market.

MSEB reportedly owes central utilities Rs 5,000 crore. They cannot bring themselves to charge many types of users for the power consumed, nor can they prevent large-scale theft of electricity. Few, including wealthy Maharashtra, have the will to reform state electricity boards and privatise transmission and distribution. Given this profile of buyers, private generators demand sovereign guarantees to help them tide over default risks. But the guarantees merely insulate IPPs against risk. They cannot make SEBs solvent. Yet, India needs power desperately. Maharashtra, India,s richest state, experiences power shortages of around 2,000 MW, about a sixth of its peak needs. Over time, the hunger for power will only grow. India cannot afford to wait for the painful politics of SEB reform to work themselves out. The government should bring in legislation that allows IPPs to sell power directly to paying customers.This will free IPPs from the clutches of bankrupt monopsony buyers. The power trading legislation will have unexpectedly happy consequences for the government too.Once IPPs are freed from their onerous obligations to sell power to single, mostly bankrupt buyers, their default risks will come down substantially. New Delhi and state governments should then scrap the guarantees that they gave IPPs in the past. The combination of power trading, private investments in generation, transmission and distribution, and gradual SEB reform  will create a commercial, workable and competitive power market in India. Anything less will be a recipe for disaster. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------State not to give tax sops to DPC for buying naphtha from IOC, (Sanjay Jog)  Thursday Jan 18 2001The Maharshtra government's finance department, which is striving to reduce fiscal deficit from Rs 9,484 crore to Rs 3,484 crore by the beginning of April this year, has expressed its inability to provide a sales tax waiver to the Dabhol Power Company (DPC) on the procurement of 1.2 million tonne of naphtha from the state-run Indian Oil Corporation (IOC). Mantralaya sources told The Financial Express on Wednesday that DPC would have to pay 4 per cent sales tax. ""The government, way back in 1995, has modified the sales tax rate to 4 per cent to discourage the import of naphtha from Gujarat by electrical companies operating in Maharashtra. The decision was taken with a view to encouraging electrical companies to procure naphtha at reduced rates within the state,"" government sources added. Sources said that these companies had to pay nearly 15.3 per cent sales tax on naphtha that was procured from Gujarat. However, following their representation, the government slashed the sales tax rate to 4 per cent. The state finance department's opinion, which would be presented before the state cabinet shortly in order to take a final decision, deserves special significance especially when the state energy department and the loss-making Maharashtra State Electricity Board (MSEB) have wholeheartedly supported the DPC's cause and recommended the sales tax waiver. DPC, which was asked by the Union ministry of oil and petroleum to procure naphtha within the country in view of excess availability, in its presentation to the state government and to MSEB, had made it clear that it would be left with no alternative but to pass on the additional burden on the MSEB which would be ultimately passed on to its consumers. DPC had also told the state government that it had not paid sales tax on the procurement of naphtha from Glencore in the calender year 2000. Sources from the state energy department and MSEB have stressed on the need for such a waiver while expressing their inability to bear additional burden. They have suggested that the state should reciprocate by offering a sales tax exemption to DPC because the IOC, at the behest of the Centre, has tried to match the international landing price of naphtha during the recently signed memorandum of agreement with DPC. ""If the state finance department sticks to its views, it may hurt the state as a whole,"" sources from the state energy department and MSEB said.DPC will procure naphtha at Rs 11,050 per ton from IOC during the calender year 2001 as compared to the Rs 10,050 per tonne price quoted by Glencore. The naphtha price comprises $175 per tonne free on board (FOB), 21.8 per cent of customs duty, 5.4 per cent of sales tax and $18.87 of premium. DPC senior vice president Mukesh Tyagi reiterated that the company has already made an appeal to the state government for the sales tax waiver on naphtha in the larger interest of the consumers. ""Sales tax is a pass through and MSEB, which will have to bear the additional burden, will pass it on the consumers,"" he added.-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Centre yet to receive proposal on EnronThursday Jan 18 2001CENTRE on Wednesday said that it had not recevied any proposal from Maharashtra government seeking help to solve the tangle with the Enron promoted Dhabol Power Project relating to cost and surplus power. Asked about the reports that Maharashtra government was sending a proposal that centre buy surplus power from Dhabol Power Company through power trading corporation, power minister Suresh Prabhu said ""we have not received any proposal."" ""We are carefully watching the situation and will await a concrete proposal before intervening in this matter,"" Parbhu said on the sidelines of greentech environment excellence awards ceremony, here. Asked whether there was any possibility of the government asking the Power Trading Corporation to buy power from the Dhabol Power Corporation, Prabhu replied ""what will the PTC do with the power?"" Prabhu had earlier asked the state government to study the matter before approaching the centre for payment of dues. MSEB had earlier declined to pick up its 15 per cent stake in phase II of the 1444 mw project. The Enron issue has been hanging fire with the Maharashtra State Electricity Board unable to clear the dues of DPC as a result of the skyrocketing prices of Naphtha infact MSEB has asked DPC to backdown completely leading to a situation where DPC has stopped production at the facility from the begining of the month.State government has stepped in with support to the tune of Rs 114 crore to enable MSEB to clear the dues for October. MSEB dues to DPC for November and December amount to over Rs 300 crores. "john.enerson@enron.com,"james.fallon@enron.com, lucy.marshall@enron.com, fred.lagrasta@enron.com, ","Tue, 14 Dec 1999 02:14:00 -0800 (PST)",2:14:00,,,"	edward.ondarza@enron.com, bryan.burnett@enron.com, 	david.kistler@enron.com, lynda.clemmons@enron.com, 	stinson.gibner@enron.com, vince.kaminski@enron.com, 	john.hopley@enron.com, mark.warner@enron.com, 	marshall.eubank@enron.com, david.martin@enron.com, 	brian.vass@enron.com, christie.connell@enron.comSubject: Imperial Capital - Thursday ScheduleMime-Version: 1.0Content-Type: text/plain; charset=us-asciiContent-Transfer-Encoding: 7bitX-From: John EnersonX-To: James B Fallon, Lucy M Marshall, Fred Lagrasta, Edward Ondarza, Bryan Burnett, David Kistler, Lynda Clemmons, Stinson Gibner, Vince J Kaminski, John Hopley, Mark Warner, Marshall Eubank, David Martin, Brian Vass, Christie ConnellX-cc: X-bcc: X-Folder: \Vincent_Kaminski_Jun2001_9\Notes Folders\C:\Technote\Mail\ProjectsX-Origin: Kaminski-VX-FileName: vkamins.nsfThe following is the schedule for Thursday's meeting with Imperial Capital.  Currently all meetings are scheduled in EB 2868.

Mars is a private company, considered to be the largestprivately ownedmanufacturing company in the world.  Mars is not in the habit of disclosing itsfinances,so the best I could do is refer to Forbes' estimate of $15 Billion annualrevenue andto the profit margins of similar companies between 5-12%.  Mars is in thebusiness ofmanufacturing confectionery (m&m, Dove bar, skittles, twix, - all (R))food (Uncle Ben rice (R))  pet food (Pedigree, Whiskas Waltham (R)) and otherproducts.Mars has prospered during the years because of a unique philosophy thatemphasizes thelong term goals of the company.  Part of the philosophy is to look for win-winsolutions withits suppliers, customers and partners.As can be understood from the nature of the company, a large chunk of itsexpensesgoes towards purchasing commodity like products, and hence the history ofresearchingthose commodities and the weather that influences their supply and the demand(peopleeat less ice cream in the winter and less chocolate in the summer).CDS has a history of few decades in forecasting  weather and has been verysuccessful,with an envious track record, in helping Mars get a competitive advantage inthese arenas.CDS is a global group (in 4 countries across two continents) which supports thepurchasingfunction and the corporate at large in these and other arenas.  It is amultidiscipline andmultinational team with a lot to offer.Not having a ready access to the energy markets, and with a risk profile basedonmanufacturing expertise, Mars has decided to look for potential partners in thisarea.Enron presence in the market place certainly makes it an interesting party totalk to.In talking to Enron, we are careful to suggest that Mars is not committing toanythingat this point, and all we are after is to find out if there is an interest topursue the opportunitywe discussed in the future.I am looking forward to our video conference call.Kind regards,Avi---------------------------------------Avi I.

As it turns out, Christian left RAC in April and joined the Petrochem Desk as a trader.  Previous efforts at construction of a forward curve by the group have focused on intuition or SWAGs.  Unfortunately, the group had a rough P&L year with at least some of the blame directed toward the forward curve or lack thereof.  When asked about the fundamentals group, Christian indicated that they'd only been around about 3-4 months and are not yet well-suited to curve building.  John Nowlan is indeed the head of the group.   >From a timing perspective, I told Christian that it would probably take at least 6-8 weeks to develop a curve, especially considering the need to understand the key market drivers/fundamentals.  As was suggested yesterday during our meeting, a strong relationship between petrochemicals and a NYMEX component (e.g., crude oil) would provide a great beginning point--we could then potentially strengthen/augment  this relationship with other key factors (e.g., supply and demand terms) borne out of our market research.Nelson<Embedded Picture (Device Independent Bitmap)>"vince.kaminski@enron.com,michael.danielson@enron.com,"Fri, 30 Jun 2000 07:31:00 -0700 (PDT)",7:31:00,Re: EOL Phase 2,,"Michael,Please, contact Zimin Lu.Vince KaminskiMichael Danielson06/30/2000 01:10 PMTo: Vince J Kaminski/HOU/ECT@ECT, Mike A Roberts/HOU/ECT@ECTcc: Angela Connelly/LON/ECT@ECT, Savita Puthigai/NA/Enron@Enron Subject: EOL Phase 2  Thanks for your help on content for EOL phase 2.An additional piece of content that we are trying to include in our scope is an options calculator.

The objective, as they explain it, is to allow the Desk to buy non-firm from the market, buy David's outage product, and sell firm to the market.  Accountants would like a curve to mark the non-firm position.	My initial thought is that the desk should provide this non-firm curve, but it seems that this market is very illiquid and they are reluctant so they have put the ball in David Hoog's court to build the curve if David wants to sell his product internally to the desk.  	Assuming we build the curve, the next issue is how to define ""non-firm""?  The only way I can think of is to tie the non-firmness to a specific generation unit or group of units.  This will allow the purchase of David's outage product to cover the non-firmness risk.  Tying the definition of non-firmness to a whole region seems implausible --- what does it mean to give a marketer the option to not deliver power if there is any problem anywhere in the region?  Consequently, the non-firm curve takes on a unit-level interpretation, and not a region-level interpretation.  Consequently, I do not see how we can talk about the ""non-firm curve for the region""?  We will need to build a non-firm curve for each generation unit or group of units.Maybe I could get your thoughts later today.Thanks,	Vasant"dale.nesbitt@marketpointinc.com,vince.j.kaminski@enron.com,"Sun, 21 Jan 2001 16:02:00 -0800 (PST)",16:02:00,Tuesday Morning Meeting First Thing???,,"Vince:I am sorry I couldnt connect with you last week.

I've think that Fallon has a new attitude on these deals and Enron has committed to help them figure out this market.Power plant balancing model - we have in our portfolio and will be offering balancing/storage services for Chicago area power projects.  We would like to have a model or at least a better understanding to help us with this endeavor.We have resources in Chicago dedicated to these projects, as well as the other stuff we're trying to do like negotiate contracts and set up the Chicago back office function.

Then, by going back and incorporating obvious dates from the calendars for 1997-1999, the following regression analysis is made, where each effect is added independently:giving this Sunday = $4403+ a minor $3 weekly time trend (i.e., multiply by the number of weeks since Jan. 5, 1997)+ no pure effect from last week's contributions (i.e., denies first-order autoregressive effects)+ $2426 if Easter Sunday or the Sunday nearest Christmas+ $9695 if (pastoral appeal) April 19,1998 or April 25,1999- $340 if the Sunday falls on the weekend of a Monday Federal holiday- $50 if the Sunday following Thanksgiving- $73  if a Summer weekend (June 1 thru August 31)The pure time trend is very small, so an annual projection based on all 3 years data would be for giving to increase only a minor amount ($150) for 2000 assuming a similar appeal for giving is made this April.Clayton"vince.kaminski@enron.com,stinson.gibner@enron.com,"Fri, 1 Dec 2000 00:00:00 -0800 (PST)",0:00:00,Re: Compound Model for Reedy Creek,,"	berney.aucoin@enron.comMime-Version: 1.0Content-Type: text/plain; charset=us-asciiContent-Transfer-Encoding: 7bitBcc: vince.kaminski@enron.com, alex.huang@enron.com, vasant.shanbhogue@enron.com, 	berney.aucoin@enron.comX-From: Vince J KaminskiX-To: Stinson GibnerX-cc: Vince J Kaminski, Alex Huang, Vasant Shanbhogue, Berney C AucoinX-bcc: X-Folder: \Vincent_Kaminski_Jun2001_5\Notes Folders\C:\Technote\Mail\ProjectsX-Origin: Kaminski-VX-FileName: vkamins.nsfStinson,I think the gamma will flow into V@R.VinceStinson Gibner11/30/2000 06:14 PMTo: Alex Huang/Corp/Enron@ENRONcc: Vince J Kaminski/HOU/ECT@ECT, Vasant Shanbhogue/HOU/ECT@ECT Subject: Compound Model for Reedy CreekAlex,Paulo and I have continued to look at the model and have come up with a couple of additional changes.1.

Jarrow"" <raj15@cornell.edu>, ""Robert C. Merton"" <rmerton@hbs.edu> Subject: Mr. Jeffrey K. SkillingPresident and C.O.O.,Enron Corp.Dear Jeff,This email is from Robert Jarrow (Cornell) and myself (Joe Cherian). I hopeyou recall meeting/lunching with Bob Jarrow & me when you keynoted at my1999 Math Finance Day conference here at Boston University. I wanted tointroduce you to SKG Inc., a startup that is focused on providing aninnovative service to the electronic trading community. Messers KuppuswamySeshadhri, Sriketan Mahanti, and Gaurav Mallik are the principal foundersof SKG, Inc. Bob Jarrow and I represent the company's Scientific AdvisoryBoard. Nobel laureate Robert Merton, who also sat on our table during yourkeynote address, very kindly serves as an ad hoc Senior Advisor to SKG andhas been an invaluable resource to SKG, including putting us in touch withJP Morgan. Coincidentally, the C.O.O. of JP Morgan Capital Corp. EdColloton, in an April 7 meeting told us he would introduce us to the C.F.O.of Enron Online, whom he knows and at which he felt SKG would have hugevalue-adding opportunities. However, given Ed's busy travel schedule, Idon't believe he has been able to do that yet. Hence this joint decision byBob Jarrow and myself to send you this email.SKG's solution is to provide dynamic pricing and value maximization inelectronic trading of securities/commodities on ECNs and ATSs (AlternativeTrading Systems). It achieves this through a process of ""strategicnegotiation"" using automated agents (intelligent software manifestations).Our system should not be viewed as an ECN, but rather as an enhancement toany extant trading system, be it an ECN, ATS, CLOB, NASDAQ, etc. Ourinitial system design has been conducted for financial instruments trading,e.g. bonds/equities, but our strategy is as much applicable to energy/powerinstruments trading, high speed communications bandwidth trading, and otherweb-based commodities trading, which we believe is of interest to EnronOnline.SKG is superior to existing solutions in the following way:1)  It considers multiple attributes, e.g., price, time, volatility,bandwidth. (In high speed communication bandwidth scenarios, for example,the dimensions could be price, bandwidth size, time for which bandwidthavailable, continguity of the allocation, and such.)2) It involves dynamic matching as opposed to ""static"" matching.3) It is multi-lateral.4)  It adapts itself dynamically to changing market conditions.5) It allows traders to make important trade-offs, as they do intraditional markets.Currently, SKG is involved in discussions with the Heads of Trading atFidelity, Putnam Investments, Lehman Bros., KPMG, Meridien Research,Salomon Smith Barney, JP Morgan, State Street, Banc of America, McKinsey,Citizens Power, and a host of other folks.We think we have a value-adding service to provide to Enron Online or anyother Enron subsidiary that the SKG offering matches and that you deem fit.SKG's founders and I will be very happy to provide you or yourrepresentative(s) with more details, including a demo of the prototype, ina meeting. We are therefore hopeful that you will be able to arrangesomething appropriate.Thanks very much, Jeff! We look forward to hearing from you.With warm regards,Joseph Cherian and Robert JarrowCc: Professor Robert C. MertonJoseph A.

Mars is a private company, considered to be the largestprivately ownedmanufacturing company in the world.  Mars is not in the habit of disclosing itsfinances,so the best I could do is refer to Forbes' estimate of $15 Billion annualrevenue andto the profit margins of similar companies between 5-12%.  Mars is in thebusiness ofmanufacturing confectionery (m&m, Dove bar, skittles, twix, - all (R))food (Uncle Ben rice (R))  pet food (Pedigree, Whiskas Waltham (R)) and otherproducts.Mars has prospered during the years because of a unique philosophy thatemphasizes thelong term goals of the company.  Part of the philosophy is to look for win-winsolutions withits suppliers, customers and partners.As can be understood from the nature of the company, a large chunk of itsexpensesgoes towards purchasing commodity like products, and hence the history ofresearchingthose commodities and the weather that influences their supply and the demand(peopleeat less ice cream in the winter and less chocolate in the summer).CDS has a history of few decades in forecasting  weather and has been verysuccessful,with an envious track record, in helping Mars get a competitive advantage inthese arenas.CDS is a global group (in 4 countries across two continents) which supports thepurchasingfunction and the corporate at large in these and other arenas.  It is amultidiscipline andmultinational team with a lot to offer.Not having a ready access to the energy markets, and with a risk profile basedonmanufacturing expertise, Mars has decided to look for potential partners in thisarea.Enron presence in the market place certainly makes it an interesting party totalk to.In talking to Enron, we are careful to suggest that Mars is not committing toanythingat this point, and all we are after is to find out if there is an interest topursue the opportunitywe discussed in the future.I am looking forward to our video conference call.Kind regards,Avi---------------------------------------Avi I.

You request Enron position after successful market order, but not after limit order  -- you may want it after limit order as well to be consistent.  I am not clear on how you would use Enron position.  It is possible that the trading desk will have a target position in mind and they will set bids and offers in such a way as to try to achieve that target position, but this target position probably changes continuously and is not stored anywhere, and without this target position there is nothing to compare actual Enron position to.  Of course, Enron position may still provide some insights.2.  You request bid-mid-ask prices for each trade --- given that a successful trade may execute later than time of order (especially for limit orders), would you need the evolution or range of bid-mid-ask over this time interval (time of order to time of execution)?  Also, for failed trades, you may need the evolution or range of bid-mid-ask over the time interval from time of order to time of rejection.  This again mainly applies to limit orders, as the time intervals may not be significant for market orders given the speed of execution (something to check). -----Original Message-----From:  Lee, Bob  Sent: Monday, April 23, 2001 8:33 AMTo: Kaminski, Vince; Shanbhogue, Vasant; Barkley, TomCc: Lu, Zimin; Huang, Alex; Gibner, StinsonSubject: EOL Pricing AlgorithmA draft data request for EOL data we would use to study P&L patterns for the ""George"" pricing algorithm is attached for your review.  I would like to send this to Andy Zipper and Jay Webb this afternoon.Bob << File: Trade Data Request.doc >> "shirley.crenshaw@enron.com,amy.oberg@enron.com,"Fri, 28 Jul 2000 04:11:00 -0700 (PDT)",4:11:00,Value Lab Meeting on the 1st of August,,"Amy:Below are the individuals Vince wants to include in this meeting.

The objective, as they explain it, is to allow the Desk to buy non-firm from the market, buy David's outage product, and sell firm to the market.  Accountants would like a curve to mark the non-firm position. My initial thought is that the desk should provide this non-firm curve, but it seems that this market is very illiquid and they are reluctant so they have put the ball in David Hoog's court to build the curve if David wants to sell his product internally to the desk.   Assuming we build the curve, the next issue is how to define ""non-firm""?  The only way I can think of is to tie the non-firmness to a specific generation unit or group of units.

Tying the definition of non-firmness to a whole region seems implausible --- what does it mean to give a marketer the option to not deliver power if there is any problem anywhere in the region?  Consequently, the non-firm curve takes on a unit-level interpretation, and not a region-level interpretation.  Consequently, I do not see how we can talk about the ""non-firm curve for the region""?  We will need to build a non-firm curve for each generation unit or group of units.Maybe I could get your thoughts later today.Thanks, Vasant"sandeep.kohli@enron.com,neil.mcgregor@enron.com,"Thu, 25 Jan 2001 17:58:00 -0800 (PST)",17:58:00,Re: Anshuman,,"Neil,You must have already gotten my earlier mail of clarification.

Enron is not currently in the business of developing or manufacturing electrical generation equipment and does not plan, as far as I know, to enter this business.   The one exception is our ownership in entities developing wind and solar, renewable energy.2.  Enron does not have the proper facilities or expertise to test or develop Mr. Pattesons proposed generator.3.  There could be substantial risk in testing this generator as it would involve boiling of a flammable material under pressure.4.  I do not believe that the proposed generator will produce any significant quantity of electrical power.   The generator produces power by induction.  That is, electric current is induced by a changing magnetic field.   The mechanism powering the changing magnetic field is the movement of magnetic dipoles which are suspended in a boiling medium.   As the boiling will produce a somewhat random movement of the liquid, the ""movement"" or change in the magnetic field will be highly random and thus not suitable for producing a steady or reliable electrical current.I have asked Martin Lin to also review the documents to render an independent opinion of this proposal.Respectfully,Dr. Stinson GibnerPhD.

As it turns out, Christian left RAC in April and joined the Petrochem Desk as a trader.  Previous efforts at construction of a forward curve by the group have focused on intuition or SWAGs.  Unfortunately, the group had a rough P&L year with at least some of the blame directed toward the forward curve or lack thereof.  When asked about the fundamentals group, Christian indicated that they'd only been around about 3-4 months and are not yet well-suited to curve building.  John Nowlan is indeed the head of the group.   >From a timing perspective, I told Christian that it would probably take at least 6-8 weeks to develop a curve, especially considering the need to understand the key market drivers/fundamentals.

I am assuming here that this will be more of an introductory meeting where both sides are feeling out the other.  The two meetings I had arranged over the weekend, would hopefully, have given you a better idea of the thinking of at least these two people o the issue.Incidentally, in the Indian system, the Governor of any state is a Central government nominee.  He is the eyes and ears of the Central govt. in the state.  Please see Basak's meeting in that light.  The message he takes will likely go directly to the PMO in Delhi.  I will therefore be working closely to convey the right impression.For N.K.Singh clearly there are three things you would try to convey:A description of the problem, Some of the resultant consequences if it is not solved soon enough, andConveying the fact that there are win-win solutions well within the GoI's power to implement, that would in fact enhance his reputation and the country's as one that lives up to its reputationI would be careful to make the point that we are NOT going to give up any value, but are willing to be accomodative to MSEB, GoM, and GoI needs, either through financial re-engineering, or through getting direct access to the market in some areas.  This will also fly well with Enron management that is more comfortable with market risks than political.Describing the ProblemDPC has a PPA, backed by GoI & GoM guarantees for one of the most high profile projects in the world (World's largest gas fired power plant, India's first LNG terminal, gateway to providing clean reliable energy for all of western India, development of Konkan)With coming of Phase II (due end-2001) cost of power from Dabhol will be more competitive than any other liquid fuel fired plant (low heat rates, larger turbines, spreading of infrastructure costs over a larger base, use of LNG as fuel)(Our average tariff at 90% despatch is Rs. 4.02/kWh for Phase I.  This goes down to Rs. 3.30 - 3.70/kWh with coming in of Phase II.  Compare this with NTPC's own Kayamkulam plant having a tariff of Rs.3.32 - 4.01for same range of crude prices ($21-28/barrel).  Hence DPC power is competitive, our standards of performance are higher, penalties for non-performance are greater, and as a private player, our place in the waterfall seems to be lower (quote the fact that while we have been delayed in payment by 45-60 days, MSEB has made all of its other payment commitments).However, monthly outflows could be as much as Rs. 450 Cr./month; MSEB's monthy collections not improving - are in the range of Rs. 900 Cr./month  MSEB, and GoM clearly do not have the resources, in the short run (3-5 yrs.) to meet these obligations; hence Central intervention is needed.In a grid of 13000 MW (Maharashtra grid size), absorbing an additional 1440 MW (Phase II) at one go is difficult; however if we take Western Region, grid size is 42000 MW.  Clearly absorbing all the power in that framework is much easier.  To this if we add Northern and Southern grids, we can probably evacuate out another 500-700 MW through the interconnects.  Hence, there is definitely value in looking at this issue at a national level.Additionally, it is not just solvable at that level, but actually answers to the crying need for power in the country, and hence is a boon for the govt., and should be treated as such.Consequences of Not Solving the ProblemWe can call upon the sovereign guarantee, which will cover our partial payments.  However, this would almost definitely lead to a deterioration of the country's credit rating - put back incoming investments into the Petroleum sector (where private participation program is about to be unveiled in 25 O&G blocks), telecom sector (where a new policy has been announced months ago, and where foreign companies are looking favorably at investing).It is likely to put India on the backlist of many international banks, including export credit agencies of US, Japan, and Belgium (an EEC member).It would bring to the knees many prominent Indian banks (Indian lenders to the project include IDBI, ICICI, SBI, to metion just a few)Would completely stop any new investment into the power sector, where there is urgent need for funding (especially te new initiatives in transmission)There is a timeline for solving this, since our project is coming before year-end 2001, and hence we cannot wait for the slow pace of reform to take place at the SEB and state level. Win-Win Solutions ExistNorthern region is power starved, south needs power badly.  Hence it is a boon to have this power made available in the timeframe.  With Central govt. intevention, it is possible to solve th problem to everyone's mutual benefit.1440 MW (incremental Phase II) is only 3.4% of the capacity existing in the Western Region, and can be easily absorbed.Win-Win Solutions exist by:Restructuring some of the guaranteesAdding some central govt entity (including those from the petroleum sector - IOC or GAIL, interested due to LNG trml.) to the equity mix at parBack-ending tariff and other financial re-engineering solutions that could involve Indian banks taking a greater share of the debt. et. etc.Bottom Line: Time is of essence; we need to get someone to negotiate with.  Please use your good offices to quickly form a representative group that includes Central, State govt., and SEB representatives so that we can work on the solution.Without active participation from PM's office, we are likely to waste precious time bouncing between the SEB, GoM, and various Ministries of GoI.Hope this helps.Regards,Sandeep."bob.lee@enron.com,"richard.reichardt@enron.com, vince.kaminski@enron.com","Mon, 16 Oct 2000 05:52:00 -0700 (PDT)",5:52:00,Re: Seismic Data via satellite,,"FYI---------------------- Forwarded by Bob Lee/NA/Enron on 10/16/2000 11:46 AM ---------------------------Gregory P Smith@ECT10/16/2000 10:06 AMTo: Bob Lee/NA/Enron@ENRONcc:  Subject: Re: Seismic Data via satellite  	Bob,Here are a few comments on this note:1. Deal with seismic company was done by a Mark Peterson who is still with Enron.  I haven't caught up with him for details but it had to do with underwriting (risk of no sales) seismic survey.  Timing is important.  Interest may have picked up in new surveys and the survey company decided that they didn't need Enron anymore because they no longer saw a risk of no sales.  2. 3-D surveys will happen where there is an abundance of E & P activity or be spurred on by successes in a given basin.  While activity continues in the Gulf of Mexico on the shelf, the major discoveries are being found in the deep water.  Worldwide, the shallow water plays have been looked at and worked for years - they were accessible with the extraction technology of the time.  I don't think that deep water sedimentation /depositional systems were completely understood to even begin to try to justify looking in deep water.  Concepts have evolved quite quickly.  The point is that many deep water accumulations are incredibly large - billion barrel accumulations.  These sizes are like those accumulations that were found decades ago when companies were drilling surface structures.  The large reserves are needed to pay for the corresponding incredibly expensive costs of deepwater field development.  I believe that finding and development costs ($/barrel) are at least two to three times shelf f & d costs in the Gulf of Mexico.  This differential is probably large with international projects (and that doesn't take into account political risk). I'll look forward to more involvement if and when this project /concept goes forward.

I was not involved in the LNG ship project. I shall  read the DASH and give you my comments. Without looking at the details, I think that the decisionto charter a tanker removes one significant risk we have at the Elba Island project (please, see point 2).2. Elba Island. I am working with Doug Rotenberbg, Brad Hitch, Scott Earnest (Sally Beck's organization) and RAC to set up the book for the Elba Island transaction. The next stepwill be to expand the book to capture all the Enron's LNG-related  positions  in one place andto look for natural risk offsets and possible hedges. A working group is meeting to close a fewremaining gaps  tomorrow (Tuesday) at 8:30.A few comments on the book design and my view of the project:a. The current thinking is that LNG will be sourced for the Elba Island facilityby buying marginal cargos on the fob basis. Marginal cargos will representsupply from excess capacity that has not been committed under long-termcontracts or became available due to some short-term frictions.The fob cargos are typically selling at a significant discount to the long-termcontract prices. The economics of the deal, as represented by the book we are setting up, will reflect the assumption that not only we can locate marginal cargosbut that we shall be able to do it on a regular basis, arranging shipping and coordinatingthe facility schedule and natural gas transactions in the US. In other words,we have a significant logistical and operational risk in this transaction.b. The transaction will cover the period of 17 years (with an extension option of5 years). Even if we can lock-in the LNG volumes over this time period, wehave no ability to lock-in the other side of the spread (US gas prices) for such a long tenor. This is  essentially a tolling transaction with exposure to the LNG - nat gas spread andI would not recommend locking-in only one leg of the spread.One solution would be to  cover, let's say, 50% of he LNG volumes for the first5 years and lock-in the nat gas side on the US market side.c. The book we are setting up will be based on many managerial assumptionsregarding sources of LNG, shipping rates, schedules, etc. I would set up a big prudence reservein case we mark it to market.d. My group will work on valuation of some options we have in the Elba Island deal(that are good for Enron) and on the hedging strategy for the LNG positions.Long-term LNG contracts are typically based on the Japanese Crude Cocktail that correlates very well with Brent.VinceJohn Sherriff05/14/2000 01:40 AMTo: Vince J Kaminski/HOU/ECT@ECTcc: Lauren Urquhart/LON/ECT@ECT Subject: LNG May 19 decisionVinceI haven't spoken to you for awhile but hope the world is treating you well.  Anyway with Greg moving to hisnew role I have (I hope only temporarily) staff trading oversight for the Eastern Hemishere plus LNG.I understand that your group is taking a first cut at developing curves for LNG and LNG ship values.

You request Enron position after successful market order, but not after limit order  -- you may want it after limit order as well to be consistent.  I am not clear on how you would use Enron position.  It is possible that the trading desk will have a target position in mind and they will set bids and offers in such a way as to try to achieve that target position, but this target position probably changes continuously and is not stored anywhere, and without this target position there is nothing to compare actual Enron position to.  Of course, Enron position may still provide some insights.2.  You request bid-mid-ask prices for each trade --- given that a successful trade may execute later than time of order (especially for limit orders), would you need the evolution or range of bid-mid-ask over this time interval (time of order to time of execution)?  Also, for failed trades, you may need the evolution or range of bid-mid-ask over the time interval from time of order to time of rejection.  This again mainly applies to limit orders, as the time intervals may not be significant for market orders given the speed of execution (something to check). -----Original Message-----From: 	Lee, Bob  Sent:	Monday, April 23, 2001 8:33 AMTo:	Kaminski, Vince; Shanbhogue, Vasant; Barkley, TomCc:	Lu, Zimin; Huang, Alex; Gibner, StinsonSubject:	EOL Pricing AlgorithmA draft data request for EOL data we would use to study P&L patterns for the ""George"" pricing algorithm is attached for your review.  I would like to send this to Andy Zipper and Jay Webb this afternoon.Bob << File: Trade Data Request.doc >> "greg.woulfe@enron.com,"vince.kaminski@enron.com, jim.fallon@enron.com, paul.racicot@enron.com, ","Thu, 4 Jan 2001 23:05:00 -0800 (PST)",23:05:00,,,"	stinson.gibner@enron.com, russell.woody@enron.com, 	marcello.romano@enron.com, chonawee.supatgiat@enron.com, 	martin.lin@enron.com, grant.zimmerman@enron.com, 	bryan.garrett@enron.com, jay.hawthorn@enron.com, 	john.suarez@enron.com, arshak.sarkissian@enron.com, 	richard.schneider@enron.comSubject: Proposed Agenda for January 11 auction meetingMime-Version: 1.0Content-Type: text/plain; charset=us-asciiContent-Transfer-Encoding: 7bitX-From: Greg WoulfeX-To: Vince J Kaminski, Jim Fallon, Paul Racicot, Stinson Gibner, Russell Woody, Marcello Romano, Chonawee Supatgiat, Martin Lin, Grant Zimmerman, Bryan Garrett, Jay Hawthorn, John Suarez, Arshak Sarkissian, Richard SchneiderX-cc: X-bcc: X-Folder: \Vincent_Kaminski_Jun2001_5\Notes Folders\C:\Technote\Mail\ProjectsX-Origin: Kaminski-VX-FileName: vkamins.nsfLet me know if you would like anything else included.----- Forwarded by Greg Woulfe/Enron Communications on 01/05/01 07:09 AM -----______________________________________FROM 4 JANUARY 2001Dr Richard SteinbergUniversity of CambridgeThe Judge InstituteTrumpington StreetCambridge CB2 1AGEnglandtel: +44-1223-339638fax: +44-1223-339701e-mail: r.steinberg@jims.cam.ac.uk"sandeep.kohli@enron.com,,"Mon, 29 Jan 2001 12:46:00 -0800 (PST)",12:46:00,Power Trading,,"FYI.

The state also pays                     a fixed capacity charge of Rs970m (Dollars 21m) a month, reflecting the                     huge project cost and, controversially, irrespective of consumption.                      A showdown looks inevitable, reminiscent of a clash six years ago that                     damaged India's appeal to foreign investors. A former official of the World                     Bank, which has criticised the deal, says Enron is emerging ""as the East                     India Company of the 21st century"" - a reference to the British trader that                     colonised key areas of the Indian economy in the 19th century.                      The stand-off is the latest blot on India's power sector. The UK's PowerGen                     and Cogentrix of the US have quit India recently, frustrated by long approval                     procedures, inadequate payments mechanisms or because of higher                     returns elsewhere.                      ""India has lost time and opportunity and has driven returns down by six                     percentage points,"" says Gerry Grove-White, former India general manager                     of PowerGen, which has sold its 655MW plant in Gujarat to China Light &                     Power of Hong Kong.                      India's national plan for the five years to 2002 says generating capacity                     must rise by 40,000MW to about 120,000MW. But since 1992, IPPs have                     added only 3,000MW and 2,500MW remains under construction. This is                     insufficient to support official projections of 6 to 8 per cent economic                     growth.                      Enron was a bellwether of India's liberalisation, winning fast-track project                     approval in the early 1990s. Phase 1, a 740MW plant fuelled by expensive                     naphtha came on stream in May 1999, and phase 2, a Dollars 1.87bn plant                     of 1,624MW capacity that will run on cheaper liquefied natural gas (LNG),                     will be completed this year. Only two of seven other fast-track proposals                     have achieved financial closure.                      From the outset Enron encountered attacks, culminating in Maharashtra's                     then nationalist government cancelling the project before renegotiating                     terms no less onerous. Vilasrao Deshmukh, chief minister of the successor                     government, says the power purchase agreement is unaffordable.                      Enron, whose attackers also include cultural chauvinists, wants to maintain                     good political relations in a hostile but lucrative environment. Enron views                     India as a testing ground for its evolution from a traditional manager of                     power plants to a broad-based trader of commodities, such as energy, gas                     and bandwidth.                      To support these ambitions Enron hopes to trade energy between power                     surplus and deficit states, once legislation is passed this year. It is building                     an LNG terminal and pipelines to trade imported natural gas. And it is                     laying a 15,000km fibre-optic network to trade bandwidth space in a country                     desperately short of this new economy commodity.                      In any event, Enron believes it has a watertight contract. It is supported by                     many that believe any subversion of the contract would confirm investor                     perception of Maharashtra, India's financial and industrial hub, as an                     unreliable destination for investment.                      Mr Deshmukh - who has avoided the language of his predecessor, which                     threatened to ""dump Dabhol into the Arabian Sea"" - is under pressure from                     radical members of his wobbly coalition. But his options are limited.                     Scrapping the project would be ruinous for an economically troubled state                     that would have to compensate shareholders.                      Maharashtra State Electricity Board, the local utility and Enron's main                     client, is obliged to dispatch or ""off-take"" 90 per cent of Dabhol's output. Yet                     MSEB has never honoured these guarantees. Its off-take has averaged 60                     per cent since the plant opened and, in effect, MSEB has been paying a lot                     more while consuming a lot less power.                      One reason off-take is low is because the state's tough new regulator has                     told MSEB to buy from cheaper sources. Enron says the tariff would be                     Rs4.02/kWh if MSEB's off-take averaged 90 per cent. But with off-take a                     third lower, the average tariff is Rs4.94 per unit, and often higher. In                     October, the tariff was Rs6.91 per unit, when off-take was about 49 per                     cent. Enron says tariffs should come down when phase 2, run on cheaper                     LNG, starts.                      These cost pressures have forced MSEB to take up only half of a 30 per                     cent equity option in phase 2. Enron has acquired the balance and                     mandated bankers to find a buyer.                      Enron's difficulties have undermined the appeal of IPPs, which have failed to                     deliver the flood of investments. Potential IPPs feared they would never be                     paid by state generating boards that have become a byword for corrupt                     management of power.                      Reform of state electricity boards, whose uneconomic pricing means                     industrial users subsidise poor farmers, as well as transmission and                     distribution (T&D) services to check huge theft and technical losses, is                     overdue. ""Given the limited resources, money would be better spent on T&D                     rather than on new plant,"" says Oliver Blackaby, managing director of N M                     Rothschild in India, which is advising Karnataka on the privatisation of its                     distribution network.                      For the moment, attention is fixed on Enron's ability to satisfy the                     competing interests of investors and clients. As Sanjay Bhatnagar, chief                     executive officer of Enron India, said in a recent trade magazine, one of the                     key lessons learned from phase 2 is ""having flexibility to deal with                     externalities"".                      Copyright: The Financial Times Limited  , Copyright The Financial Times Limited 2000.

PSerc has 11 school members  and 30 industry members. Its ResearchProgram consists of three stems:  Markets, Transmission and Distribution,and Systems. (Enron's interests probably lie mainly in the first stem.) In morning of the first day, researchers from universitiespresented their project proposals. I found some of them quite interesting. For example, Shmuel Oren, Fernando Alvarado,Tim Mount (of Cornell) propose to study ""Market Redesign: Incorporatingthe lessons learned from actual experiences for enhancing marketdesign,""  Shijie Deng, S. Oren et al propose to study "" Power assetvaluation model in a market-based and reliability-constrained electricpower system."" The first got funded but the second did not. In the same afternoon industry and academic separated to have theirown discussion. I went to the academic discussion and Lance theindustry one.  I hope my presence there did not make things worse, forthe discussion revealed a lot of organizational chaos and confusion. The proposal screen process got a lot of heat from participants. The proposal process goes as follows: researchers first write a short proposal to appropriate stem committee (no industry participantion, it seems to me),each committee then ranks the proposal and selects the top 3 or 4. The selectedproposals are then expanded to be present to the industry.  Industry thengets to vote which proposals get funded.  However, some researchers werevery unhappy about the initial ranking and selection process. There wereaccusation of self-ranking, communication between stem committee andmember schools breaking down, and so on. Some were even asking for some sort of assurance that the project will be funded even before  wrting it (the arguement was ""Then it was a waste of our time to write proposals"", which I found quite amusing). All in all, I found the process was not taken seriously enough by university researchers. PSerc has been established for 5 years now and it still does not have a proper proposal screen process, which is hard to believe. Also, the communication among university researchers, between stem committee and member schools, and most importantly, between researchers and industry, are not  smooth as all.Since the proposals are voted by 30 or so industry members, the ""right""projects may not get funded. Too many participants also make the decisionprocess very indecisive and quite painful to watch (Lance can comment onthis better).  They also wanted to spread the fund among all schools whichmade the voting a less authoritive.I believe Enron will not get much returns from join PSerc (price tag is $40,000per company per year).  If we find some projects interesting, we can sponsorthe schools in the form of summer interns, the schools claim that most of the fundgoes to support students anyway. Alex"chonawee.supatgiat@enron.com,mike.roberts@enron.com,"Tue, 17 Oct 2000 14:14:00 -0700 (PDT)",14:14:00,program,,"I forgot to attach the program file.

Rich sent to many people a writing explaining his movie trading idea and asked us to provide some feedback.I think the idea (see below) might be applicable to other parts of Enron. We can call it ""Dynamic bid-ask price process"".In fact, we can set that the bidding period is closed when no new bid is submitted to the system within a specified amount of time. The final (clearing) bid and ask prices are just the last ""tentative"" price shown to the public before the bidding period ends.

Otherwise, if our forecast is not consistence with the market, we may have an imbalance in the bid-ask orders and we may end up taking some positions. You know, as Russ and Martin pointed out, we cannot fight with the studio and exhibitors because they have inside information and can game the price easily.One way to ensure the balance of the bid-ask orders is to embed an exchange system inside our bid-ask prices front end. Each week, we have a trading period. During the period, instead of posting bid-ask prices, we post ""tentative"" bid-ask prices, then we ask our customers to submit their acceptable buying or selling price. These ""tentative"" bid-ask prices get updated and are shown to the public. Of course, customers can revise/withdraw their bids anytime during the trading period. At the end of the period, we calculate and post the final bid and ask prices. The seller who submits lower selling price than our final bid price gets paid at the bid price. The buyer who submits higher buying price than our final ask price pays at the ask price. Next week, we repeat the same process.This way, we can manage our positions easily and we can also behave like a broker where we don't take any position at all. We make profit from those bid-ask spread. We don't have to worry about forecasting accuracy and insiders' trading because we don't have to take any position. Let the market be the one who decides the price. If we maintain our net position as zero, at the end, when all the actual gross box office numbers are reported in those publications, our customers with open long/short positions are perfectly matched. Using the mark-to-market charge can reduce credit risk.Thanks,-Chonawee---------------------- Forwarded by Chonawee Supatgiat/Corp/Enron on 04/24/2001 07:24 PM ---------------------------Chonawee Supatgiat04/20/2001 04:31 PMTo:	Richard DiMichele/Enron Communications@Enron Communications, Key Kasravi/Enron Communications@Enron Communicationscc:	Martin Lin/Contractor/Enron Communications@Enron Communications Subject:	some more inputHi Rich and Key,Again I think your idea is very good. I think that we, as a market maker, can reduce our credit risk (risk of default) if we do the ""mark-to-market"" charging. That is, each week when we release a new expected value of the gross box office receipt, we balance all the opening positions the same way as in a regular future market. This way, we can give margin calls to the couterparties who are expected to owe us a lots of money.In the last paragraph, I think the gross box office can also be determined from the market itself (i.e., if there are lots of buyers, our offer price should go up.)We can offer other derivative products such as options as well.-Chonawee"zimin.lu@enron.com,"greg.whalley@enron.com, john.lavorato@enron.com","Tue, 2 Jan 2001 19:44:00 -0800 (PST)",19:44:00,EOL WTI Historical Trade Simulation - more profitable trading,," strategyCc: vince.kaminski@enron.com, stinson.gibner@enron.comMime-Version: 1.0Content-Type: text/plain; charset=us-asciiContent-Transfer-Encoding: 7bitBcc: vince.kaminski@enron.com, stinson.gibner@enron.comX-From: Zimin LuX-To: Greg Whalley, John J LavoratoX-cc: Vince J Kaminski, Stinson GibnerX-bcc: X-Folder: \Vincent_Kaminski_Jun2001_5\Notes Folders\C:\Technote\Mail\ProjectsX-Origin: Kaminski-VX-FileName: vkamins.nsfPlease ignor my previous mail regarding the same issue, which contains some typos.Greg and John,I found that by reducing the volume per trade and increasing daily number of trades ( keeping the total volume per day constant), we can be more profitable.  This is partially because in a trending marketwe lose less money by following the market more closely. For example, suppose market move from$30 to $35. If per trade volume is 10,000 BBL and the half bid-offer spread is $1 for simplicity, we take 5 trades of short positions, the total MTM for that day is (-5-4-3-2-1)*10,000=-$150,000 and total trading volume is 50,000 BBL short.  If per trade volume is 50,000 BBL, we take one trade, the total MTM is -5*50,000= -$250,000.

I certainly appreciate the value-added that you provide in your research.I had a quick question for you regarding any anticipated Japan central bank intervention at the 15,000 level in the Nikkei.If I am understanding the mechanism correctly, BIS reserve requirements fall below certain threshold and banks can no longer lend money and meet BIS lending criteria due to improper reserve base. And this roughly happens at 15,000 level?Reason I ask is Goldman Sachs put out an article suggesting that break-evenpoint for bank holding of stocks is roughly 12,000-12,500 a different index level than the one you have mentioned. I can appreciate the difference between reserve liquidity and actual break-even on equity positions, but just wanted to clarify this point with you, as we are trying to gain a complete understanding of how a trigger would effect Japanese capital markets. And so, as I currently understand it, there are (2 ) trigger levels to watch:15,000 where banks fail BIS criteria and hence cannot extend new loans with BIS stamp of approval.

It is to give trader a better insight as to whether themarket is overvaluing/undervaluing certain Genco stocks, and trader canact accordingly.  I'm still trying to find out how trader is supposed to use it. Modeling details:The model takes in all Gencos' locational power forward prices and fuel forwardprices, and uses GARCH model to simulate one year daily prices, and thenuses a hourly profile to convert them into hourly prices.  GARCH model parametersare estimated by the consultant using and separate model and are updated twice a year, and it does not matter whether the simulation startsin January or September. Using these prices, it will determine whether a unit at a particular location will be dispatchedor not depending on A) spread of power and fuel prices, and B) whether the start-upcost can be recovered during 8 operation hours.  The unit can be dispatched atminimum and peak levels. Fixed O&M, SOX and NOX (I don't know what the last two stand for)are taken into consideration. With the simulated dispatch schedule, the model calculates the value that can be generatedby this unit, then sums it up across all units.The final value is the average of 100 simulations.  And it takes about 16 hours to run for about200 units.  After our conversation, the consultant promised to look into A) how to make the model more flexible,say, to allow a different time horizon, B) reduce spreadsheet overhead by doing calculation oneunit a time and not saving all the intermediate information (as of now it saves everything on the spreadsheet).Assuming the GARCH process is modelled correctly, I believe the methodology is OK, though it does not capture most of  the optionality. My concerns are:Whether the price processes are modelled correctly. I have to get more details before makingany conclusion.100 simulations are way too few. Unless we convert the algorithm to C, I don't see how spreadsheetcan handle more simulations. I guess that's why they contact us. But again, if Enron's buying themodel from the consulting company, why should Enron do their job for them?How trader's going to use the model output. For this I phoned Jeff (the associate who initiated allthese) and am still waiting for his returning call.  A related questions why the model horizon is one year. We can eitherOversee the conversation, but not doing actual coding for them.OrRedo the model for them. (The problem still remains that how trader's going to use the output).  But in view of the Great Wall of China separating the business units, should we do it?As of now I have a simulation model taking start-up cost, fixed O&M, rump-up delay into consideration.  It simulates monthly prices (using GBM) and takes 2 minutes 40 seconds to run 10,000 simulations for one unit for ten years (120 time steps).  It can use forward-forward vol and incorporate seasonality intoit (I understand this is debatable). (One interesting observation is that when using forward-forward volsimulation, the standard deviation is about 0.5%, while standard deviation using forward vol is about 2%. Also, incorporating seasonality increases the value by about 1.6%). Since most of the time-cost occurs in price simulation, and we are to simulate about 20 price processes,  I hope the full model (if we build it) will take a couple of hours to run for 200 units.

Otherwise, if our forecast is not consistence with the market, we may have an imbalance in the bid-ask orders and we may end up taking some positions. You know, as Russ and Martin pointed out, we cannot fight with the studio and exhibitors because they have inside information and can game the price easily.One way to ensure the balance of the bid-ask orders is to embed an exchange system inside our bid-ask prices front end. Each week, we have a trading period. During the period, instead of posting bid-ask prices, we post ""tentative"" bid-ask prices, then we ask our customers to submit their acceptable buying or selling price. These ""tentative"" bid-ask prices get updated and are shown to the public. Of course, customers can revise/withdraw their bids anytime during the trading period. At the end of the period, we calculate and post the final bid and ask prices. The seller who submits lower selling price than our final bid price gets paid at the bid price. The buyer who submits higher buying price than our final ask price pays at the ask price. Next week, we repeat the same process.This way, we can manage our positions easily and we can also behave like a broker where we don't take any position at all. We make profit from those bid-ask spread. We don't have to worry about forecasting accuracy and insiders' trading because we don't have to take any position. Let the market be the one who decides the price. If we maintain our net position as zero, at the end, when all the actual gross box office numbers are reported in those publications, our customers with open long/short positions are perfectly matched. Using the mark-to-market charge can reduce credit risk.Thanks,-Chonawee---------------------- Forwarded by Chonawee Supatgiat/Corp/Enron on 04/24/2001 07:24 PM ---------------------------Chonawee Supatgiat04/20/2001 04:31 PMTo: Richard DiMichele/Enron Communications@Enron Communications, Key Kasravi/Enron Communications@Enron Communicationscc: Martin Lin/Contractor/Enron Communications@Enron Communications Subject: some more inputHi Rich and Key,Again I think your idea is very good. I think that we, as a market maker, can reduce our credit risk (risk of default) if we do the ""mark-to-market"" charging.

I was not involved in the LNG ship project. I shall  read the DASH and give you my comments. Without looking at the details, I think that the decisionto charter a tanker removes one significant risk we have at the Elba Island project (please, see point 2).2. Elba Island. I am working with Doug Rotenberbg, Brad Hitch, Scott Earnest (Sally Beck's organization) and RAC to set up the book for the Elba Island transaction. The next stepwill be to expand the book to capture all the Enron's LNG-related  positions  in one place andto look for natural risk offsets and possible hedges. A working group is meeting to close a fewremaining gaps  tomorrow (Tuesday) at 8:30.A few comments on the book design and my view of the project:a. The current thinking is that LNG will be sourced for the Elba Island facilityby buying marginal cargos on the fob basis. Marginal cargos will representsupply from excess capacity that has not been committed under long-termcontracts or became available due to some short-term frictions.The fob cargos are typically selling at a significant discount to the long-termcontract prices. The economics of the deal, as represented by the book we are setting up, will reflect the assumption that not only we can locate marginal cargosbut that we shall be able to do it on a regular basis, arranging shipping and coordinatingthe facility schedule and natural gas transactions in the US. In other words,we have a significant logistical and operational risk in this transaction.b. The transaction will cover the period of 17 years (with an extension option of5 years). Even if we can lock-in the LNG volumes over this time period, wehave no ability to lock-in the other side of the spread (US gas prices) for such a long tenor. This is  essentially a tolling transaction with exposure to the LNG - nat gas spread andI would not recommend locking-in only one leg of the spread.One solution would be to  cover, let's say, 50% of he LNG volumes for the first5 years and lock-in the nat gas side on the US market side.c. The book we are setting up will be based on many managerial assumptionsregarding sources of LNG, shipping rates, schedules, etc. I would set up a big prudence reservein case we mark it to market.d. My group will work on valuation of some options we have in the Elba Island deal(that are good for Enron) and on the hedging strategy for the LNG positions.Long-term LNG contracts are typically based on the Japanese Crude Cocktail that correlates very well with Brent.VinceJohn Sherriff05/14/2000 01:40 AMTo: Vince J Kaminski/HOU/ECT@ECTcc: Lauren Urquhart/LON/ECT@ECT Subject: LNG May 19 decisionVinceI haven't spoken to you for awhile but hope the world is treating you well.  Anyway with Greg moving to hisnew role I have (I hope only temporarily) staff trading oversight for the Eastern Hemishere plus LNG.I understand that your group is taking a first cut at developing curves for LNG and LNG ship values.

Each day, this model takes the previous day's trader curves and adjusts them for the movement in Bloomberg yields and observed swap prices.Placement Model : uses linear regression to credit default swap prices using dummified ranges for Market Capitalization, Liquidity, KMV Score, etc.  One main issue here is that the dataset is biased towards investment grade names.  Alternate approaches looked at developing separate models for separate sunsets of names.Movement Model : provides an alert system for news.  This is under development.Current involvement of Houston Research Group members is in the development/modifications of the Placement Model, especially in thinking through the various single vs multi model approaches.  We can help in the brainstorming for better models for subsets.  One main project right now is to get a separate model for subsidiaries, and to exclude subsidiary names from the main regression.Value-at-risk is based on historical variance-covariance approach.The portfolio model is under development.Agenda for Houston Research Group members : Once sufficient data is collected, start reviewing for potential analytic relationships.Get weekly updates from London, and provide feedback.Plan on a trip if the work warrants it, once the agenda is fairly well drawn out, and data is available for analysis."eric.groves@enron.com,vince.kaminski@enron.com,"Wed, 30 Aug 2000 08:43:00 -0700 (PDT)",8:43:00,LNG Meeting,,"Vince,Before I contact the London staff about next Wednesday's meeting, I was wondering if we could move it up a little bit.

The Lab is the result of a joint effort between MIT's Sloan School of Management and Arthur Andersen (AA). Its purpose is to develop ""quantitative valuations of the intangible assets Wall Street finds increasingly important in the New Economy"" (Business Week, 2/7/00). Clearly, as Enron continues to shift from a hard asset to intangible asset based organization, the question of ""how to"" accurately and appropriate measure and value our intangible assets is becoming increasingly important.Last week, Steve Kean, Vince Kaminski, Marie Hejka, and myself met with a team from AA, the Deputy Dean of the Sloan School, and MIT's lead accounting/finance professor to discuss the intent of the Lab, expected outcomes, and how Enron may be involved. Post that meeting, the decision was made to continue to explore participation in the Lab. Enron now needs to 1) define our corporate measurement and valuation process needs, and 2) identify value attributes important to Enron and the industries in which we operate. Once defined, a follow up meeting will be held with MIT and next steps will be determined.Your expertise and assistance could significantly impact the inputs and outcomes of these next steps. Please schedule time on Tuesday August 1 from  2:00 to 3:30 to attend the next meeting, during which we will begin to identify needs and define value attributes. Location will be EB 49c4. Please notify me if you are unable to attend.Lastly, to assist with preparation for this meeting, I am attaching notes from a recently published book entitled  Cracking the Value Code: How Businesses Are Creating Wealth in the New Economy (May 2000, Boulton, Libert, Samek - Arthur Andersen).  Should you like more information on the Lab, previous meeting, book or other, please feel free to contact me.I look forward to meeting you.Regards,Amy Oberg"stinson.gibner@enron.com,vince.kaminski@enron.com,"Fri, 2 Feb 2001 08:11:00 -0800 (PST)",8:11:00,Raptor Position Reports for 1/29/01,,"Vince,   These spreadsheets have the most up to date numbers for the Raptor structures.

I apologize for the response delay.  I've gone back through the analysis that I did back in April, and have thrown around some ideas with Vince and Stinson.  The issue may be summarized as follows. The hedge relationship was derived using JCC and prompt Brent, and is valid for JCC and prompt Brent.  No problems here.  However, it will not be valid for points far out on the forward curve.  Intuitively, this hedge relationship will approach one as we move far out on the curve, but since there is no data, I can not statistically determine this.  One can imagine a term structure of heding ratios that start at 0.67 and move to 1.0, so that the back end of the curves would move together, but how fast it converges to one is anyone's guess. If there is a way of determining the historical JCC forward curve, then the hedge relationships may be estimated.  However, I have been unable to determine a rigorous approach to building the JCC curve.   I can explain this far better in person, and would like to talk as soon as possible at your convenience.  -Kevin Kindall"vince.kaminski@enron.com,vasant.shanbhogue@enron.com,"Mon, 23 Apr 2001 02:28:00 -0700 (PDT)",2:28:00,Petrochem Desk,,"Vasant,It seems we have to help them.

As it turns out, Christian left RAC in April and joined the Petrochem Desk as a trader.  Previous efforts at construction of a forward curve by the group have focused on intuition or SWAGs.  Unfortunately, the group had a rough P&L year with at least some of the blame directed toward the forward curve or lack thereof.  When asked about the fundamentals group, Christian indicated that they'd only been around about 3-4 months and are not yet well-suited to curve building.  John Nowlan is indeed the head of the group.   >From a timing perspective, I told Christian that it would probably take at least 6-8 weeks to develop a curve, especially considering the need to understand the key market drivers/fundamentals.  As was suggested yesterday during our meeting, a strong relationship between petrochemicals and a NYMEX component (e.g., crude oil) would provide a great beginning point--we could then potentially strengthen/augment  this relationship with other key factors (e.g., supply and demand terms) borne out of our market research.Nelson"mike.roberts@enron.com,"vince.kaminski@enron.com, stinson.gibner@enron.com, ","Tue, 9 Jan 2001 05:16:00 -0800 (PST)",5:16:00,,http://enaresearch.dev.corp.enron.com,"	vasant.shanbhogue@enron.com, osman.sezgen@enron.com, 	maureen.raymond@enron.com, tanya.tamarchenko@enron.com, 	zimin.lu@enron.com, jose.marquez@enron.com, 	stephen.bennett@enron.com, william.smith@enron.com, 	elena.chilkina@enron.com, steve.bigalow@enron.comSubject: the URLMime-Version: 1.0Content-Type: text/plain; charset=us-asciiContent-Transfer-Encoding: 7bitX-From: Mike A RobertsX-To: Vince J Kaminski, Stinson Gibner, Vasant Shanbhogue, Osman Sezgen, Maureen Raymond, Tanya Tamarchenko, Zimin Lu, Jose Marquez, Stephen Bennett, William Smith, Elena Chilkina, Steve BigalowX-cc: X-bcc: X-Folder: \Vincent_Kaminski_Jun2001_5\Notes Folders\C:\Technote\Mail\ProjectsX-Origin: Kaminski-VX-FileName: vkamins.nsfP.S. http://enaresearch.dev.corp.enron.com---------------------- Forwarded by Mike A Roberts/HOU/ECT on 01/09/2001 01:11 PM ---------------------------   			From:  Mike A Roberts                           01/09/2001 01:13 PM	To: Vince J Kaminski/HOU/ECT@ECT, Stinson Gibner/HOU/ECT@ECT, Vasant Shanbhogue/HOU/ECT@ECT, Osman Sezgen/HOU/EES@EES, Maureen Raymond/HOU/ECT@ECT, Tanya Tamarchenko/HOU/ECT@ECT, Zimin Lu/HOU/ECT@ECT, Jose Marquez/Corp/Enron@ENRON, Stephen Bennett/NA/Enron@ENRON, William Smith/Corp/Enron@ENRON, Elena Chilkina/Corp/Enron@Enron, Steve Bigalow/NA/Enron@Enroncc:  Subject:  Everybody,As Vince suggested, I made a topical allocation of our new website for quality control.

Alternatively, will you need to check the data real-time, perhaps at varying and multiple times during the day? c)  We will be installing this station near Sacramento, California:  We will need to know exactly what areas in/near Sacramento are suitable for the site of the weather station.  (What again was the name of the town that you mentioned Mark?)  In the interest of time, I recommend that your weather expert accompany our landman to select the site, which will allow our landman to more quickly lease and install the station.d)  You desire to have some independent security measures to deter or detect tampering. I suggest given the very short time fuse, that we first install the station and then develop security measures.e)  We will feed the data directly to the Enron weather desk.

As it turns out, Christian left RAC in April and joined the Petrochem Desk as a trader.  Previous efforts at construction of a forward curve by the group have focused on intuition or SWAGs.  Unfortunately, the group had a rough P&L year with at least some of the blame directed toward the forward curve or lack thereof.  When asked about the fundamentals group, Christian indicated that they'd only been around about 3-4 months and are not yet well-suited to curve building.  John Nowlan is indeed the head of the group.   >From a timing perspective, I told Christian that it would probably take at least 6-8 weeks to develop a curve, especially considering the need to understand the key market drivers/fundamentals.  As was suggested yesterday during our meeting, a strong relationship between petrochemicals and a NYMEX component (e.g., crude oil) would provide a great beginning point--we could then potentially strengthen/augment  this relationship with other key factors (e.g., supply and demand terms) borne out of our market research.Nelson"vince.kaminski@enron.com,stephen.stock@enron.com,"Thu, 11 Jan 2001 02:09:00 -0800 (PST)",2:09:00,Re: Progress,,"Steve,Thanks a lot. I think that having the pseudo code will go a long way towards understanding how the system works and making sure that there are nobugs in translation of a business problem (for example, complicatedcredit insurance deals with multiple triggers and conditionality) into the code.Regarding Tanya's attitude. Just a few points. 1. I don't think she has the skills to do the system administrator's workand she does not have thenecessary privileges. This explains why she keeps asking Winston for help. It'snot that the work is beneath her.2. Some members of Tanya's team came to me complaining about Winston.He effectively told them to go away and work on the ""research projects""and that he would take care of the IT issues. I don't think that it's just Tanya's issue,though I agree that a more outgoing personality would be helpful.3. The reality of this situation is that the internal customers beat  on Tanya andme whenever there is any performance problems and/or they intuitivelydisagree with the results of a run. They could not care less about thedemarcation line between IT and Research. They also want Tanyato sign off on the model and she cannot do it without full access to the code.The bottom line is that we are in full agreement: Tanya andWinston have to work as a team and I shall work on my end to make sure that it happens.Credit is emerging as a critical issue for Enron for the next few weeks andthe system cannot fail.VinceFrom: Stephen Stock/ENRON@enronXgate on 01/11/2001 08:23 AMTo: Vince J Kaminski/HOU/ECT@ECTcc:  Subject: ProgressVince,I got feedback from the lunchtime research meeting that you were talking about some specific solutions to performance of IT systems... In particular distributed processing. Also I heard that you had concerns about the use of multiple languages etc....Both of these sound like what I was discussing with you on previous occasions... Do you feel the need to discuss these further?The multi-language issue isn't really that much of an issue, as the current system is 98% java right now. Although I am a big fan of C/C++(it is my main development skill) , I am also very aware that Java is a much more evolved and robust language. I had serious doubts about the performance, but I've had a review conducted, and the results are showing the Sun Unix implementation to be nearly as fast and in some cases faster than C/C++ because of something they call Hot-Spot technology. (its an instruction caching technique, I believe). The concerns I expressed to you, were really about how technical people justify the use of a language on the strength of a relatively meaningless metric like portability.On the issue of distributed processing... the original review I had conducted by our architecture group pointed to that as a solution, and as Zhiyong Wei is already working on Global Valuation project, Winston is actively working with Zhiyong to see if he can model the VaR architecture on that, and also to find a common Valuation piece between the systems.I'd like the opportunity to talk to you about these issues if you have some time over the next few days?Also, I sat in on the Tanya / Winston meeting yesterday and as per our discussion at the elevator, I attempted to help her argument by suggesting to all present that she was trying to perform triage on the code... I.e. Seperating research domain problems from IT problems.She said that stepping through code was the only real way in which she could get a feel for where performance bottlenecks were. I asked her how she would measure that, and she said she would instrument the code manually by inserting timing elements at strategic points. I mentioned that a profiling tool could probably do this job for her. Tanya again said that stepping through code is the only way she can get an idea of the code, and that studying documentation wasn't enough. About 6 weeks ago, I commissioned a team to document the system down to psuedo-code level and will be able to provide this to you and your team soon. (in fact I've asked for a draft copy to be given to Tanya right now), and Winston is also working on a draft Research/IT ""working together"" document, which will identify how the exchange of information takes place.Tanya also gave the impression that she wants a dedicated IT developer to do all the environment setup for her, because she doesn't really want to have to do that. I think that this is probably the root cause of the issue. The IT guys are working very hard and her handling of the situation is not good, as it gives the impression that this kind of work is beneath her. She is claiming that they are un-cooperative.... they are claiming that she continually asks the same questions about set-up over and over again, and doesn't seem to want to learn how to do it. Winston on the other hand, could be more proactive in determining what is a business related model issue and an IT issue and ask for help from research.I think you Debbie and I need to work quite hard to get them to play nicely.I have asked Tanya and Winston to go ahead and work very closely together over the next few days....and Debbie Brackett and I will review their progress on Friday. In the meantime l'll be looking at setting up a working test environment that doesn't involve my main Quant guys in day to to day setup issues as a longer term solution.RegardsSteve"avi.hauser@effem.com,vince.j.kaminski@enron.com,"Tue, 20 Jun 2000 09:12:00 -0700 (PDT)",9:12:00,Introduction,,"Vince:   As way of introduction, I wanted to write a bit about Mars inc. and thenabout CDS,the unit I head.  Mars is a private company, considered to be the largestprivately ownedmanufacturing company in the world.  Mars is not in the habit of disclosing itsfinances,so the best I could do is refer to Forbes' estimate of $15 Billion annualrevenue andto the profit margins of similar companies between 5-12%.  Mars is in thebusiness ofmanufacturing confectionery (m&m, Dove bar, skittles, twix, - all (R))food (Uncle Ben rice (R))  pet food (Pedigree, Whiskas Waltham (R)) and otherproducts.Mars has prospered during the years because of a unique philosophy thatemphasizes thelong term goals of the company.  Part of the philosophy is to look for win-winsolutions withits suppliers, customers and partners.As can be understood from the nature of the company, a large chunk of itsexpensesgoes towards purchasing commodity like products, and hence the history ofresearchingthose commodities and the weather that influences their supply and the demand(peopleeat less ice cream in the winter and less chocolate in the summer).CDS has a history of few decades in forecasting  weather and has been verysuccessful,with an envious track record, in helping Mars get a competitive advantage inthese arenas.CDS is a global group (in 4 countries across two continents) which supports thepurchasingfunction and the corporate at large in these and other arenas.  It is amultidiscipline andmultinational team with a lot to offer.Not having a ready access to the energy markets, and with a risk profile basedonmanufacturing expertise, Mars has decided to look for potential partners in thisarea.Enron presence in the market place certainly makes it an interesting party totalk to.In talking to Enron, we are careful to suggest that Mars is not committing toanythingat this point, and all we are after is to find out if there is an interest topursue the opportunitywe discussed in the future.I am looking forward to our video conference call.Kind regards,Avi---------------------------------------Avi I.

Currently the trader volatility inputs are the daily vol curve and the intra-monthly vol curve. The monthly options get marked directly to the monthly curve (plus the smile) and the monthlies get marked to a time blend of monthly and intra-month vol (plus the skew).We want to change the valuation (for the Eastern books) so that the dailies get marked to the intramonth curve (which we want to call the daily curve) and the monthly gets marked to the monthly curved. There will be not vol blending done by the Enpower system for the daily and monthly option valuations. We want to make this change very soon (by early next week)2. Currently there exists one smile for every region, which is specified in terms of volatility additive  for specified dollar difference from the underlying. Since different months in a region can trade in a large range ($35 - $150) - this cannot result in accurate skew for all terms.  What we need is a system which has skew per month.We suggest, for the short term, the skew should apply only to the summer daily expiration options. We need to make this change by early next week.However, we need to start modifing  the system so that for every region we can enter a grid which has a percentage scale and specifies the skew differently for each month.  Research, has implemented this in our pricing model, and we would like this grid to be input into the valuation system.  I am enclosing the pricing model (which we both discussed yesterday) for reference. This model is however, work under construction, so pls call Alex Huang for clarifications.3. The vol input system is complex and confusing.I would very much be interested in moving to a direct database interface, which accomodates the skew inputs per region as in <2>. We should implement a UI which can input the dailies and monthlies at the moneys and the skew grid directly - so that we do not need to go through multiple iterations.I am very much interested in what we currently are releasing in Delphi and would love an early implementation for options.On all these issues, I am speaking for the East desk. I am going to touch base with West guys and see if they are on board with these changes.ThanksHarry"vince.kaminski@enron.com,wendy.king@enron.com,"Thu, 3 Aug 2000 08:26:00 -0700 (PDT)",8:26:00,Re: Backwardation hedge strategy,,"Wendy,I did not.

He said that he generally understands the logic of the deal but simplywants the risk management discipine applied to analzing the position (a reiteration of what Rick Buy had said in our meeting today).  I would simply ask Vince's team to take a quick look tommorow at valuing the ships as stand alone positions with a guess at the volatility based on historical price movements.   This wouldbe much easier than the Rainbow option approach and would allow us to roughly look at the value of the options on the other two ships.  In other words we could look at two ship  long positions with some implied volatilities and also estimate daily VARs on the ships as if they were mark to market (although I agree with David that we will not likely be able to mark the ships because they will be treated as leases).JohnJohn---------------------- Forwarded by John Sherriff/LON/ECT on 22/05/2000 19:05 ---------------------------Joe Gold22/05/2000 18:58To: John Sherriff/LON/ECT@ECTcc:  Subject: Exmar Purchase DecisionJohn,After spending a few minutes with our shipping experts in the coal and oil groups, I have a slightly different angle on the Exmar LNG vessel decision.  I would ideally like to spend the time to analyse this purchase as we do power and gas positions.  Unfortunately, we do not have that luxury and sometimes, in absence of true analytics, the most rudimentary measures can provide the best decision tools.  Here is how we would make the decision:1)  Our shipping expert confirms that $140 million for a 135,000 ton ship represents a good price relative to new build costs over the last three years and that quotes have been trending up past that number recently.  He also confirms that the current trough is the result of the default of several Far East buyers and that new LNG orders and other ship building (cruise liners) have reduced the over capacity.  His experience and historic analysis has suggested that the pricing cycle for LNG ships lasts for a significant period.  New efficiency measures should reduce new build prices (and allow for a lower trough), but not by an extreme amount versus the $140 million cost of this vessel.   Pierre normally likes to roll time charters; however, this is difficult in an illiquid shipping market like LNG.  He would purchase this ship if the LNG shipping book were his to manage.  He estimates the ship could be sold in a distressed sale for $110 million and could be potentially time chartered on a long term basis at a value of up to $200 million.  2)  Our development teams in Spain, Italy and Turkey have been trying to solve the big question - gas.  In each country, the key to developing a merchant plant is securing gas flexibility or at least securing negotiating leverage with the monopoly gas supplier.  It is questionable whether or not this decision will have an immediate impact on Arcos.  The plant's time line and the realities of the LNG supply market may require that we commit to Gas Natural before any source of 3 to 5 year gas can be secured.   The shear threat of being able to bring spot or term LNG to these markets will improve our negotiating leverage and/or allow us to create flexibility.  Going forward, however, other potential plant opportunities in Spain, and elsewhere in the Med region, may have the capacity to utilise these vessels.   I think that this flexibility is worth at least $25 million to me.3)  I would summarise:   Upside   $60 + $25 = $85 million     Downside           ($30) + $25 =             ($5)  millionI would do it.I will leave the rest to you.Joe"vince.kaminski@enron.com,mark.lay@enron.com,"Wed, 26 Jul 2000 01:14:00 -0700 (PDT)",1:14:00,Re: MEC,,"Mark,One option is to talk to a number of physicists in my group who might be interested.Vince   	Enron Investment Partners		From:  Mark Lay                           07/26/2000 07:57 AM	To: Rex Shelby/Enron Communications@Enron Communications, Steven J Kean/HOU/EES@EES, Mike McConnell, Vince J Kaminski/HOU/ECT@ECT, Philippe A Bibi/HOU/ECT@ECTcc: Kenneth Lay/Corp/Enron@ENRON, Fabricio Soares/HOU/ECT@ECT Subject: MECThank you for participating in yesterday's meeting.

Our current technology was web-scraping these pages via ftp, then parsing into a database. The impact of these 6 1/2 minutes for the hourly power traders is enormous- the weather stations upload their data around 53 minutes after the hour, and we can now receive them within 2 minutes later. We can now re-estimate our nonlinear stack model before the top of the hour, when hourly power trading begins. Otherwise, we would not have model results until around 15 minutes after the hour. Notably, hourly power trading is, for all intents and purposes, concluded by then (they trade for 10-15 minutes and manage the scheduling for the next 30 or so miutes).

We investigated about 30 comparable stocks, 10 capital market indices, and three energy commodity indices.  Regular regressions as well as regressions with different legs and leads were performed.  Some variables show significant correlated with ENE stock during particular time periods, but most of those correlation disappears when we tested them over different or longer time periods.  Only two variables, S&P Utility Index(SPXU) and  DOW Jones Utility Index(UTIL), show stable and significant relationship with ENE stock (a summary of these relationship can be found in the attached file ""outputSummary"").  But as you can see, the R2 are below 30%.  Also, the ?Durbin-Watson statistics tell us to be careful about autocorrelation.?Basically, the regression analysis so far confirms our original opinion -- ?it's hard, if not impossible, to find out any real driver of the ENE stock.  ?After Enron added new core business several month ago, the stock behaved more ?or less like a tele_comm stock,  which suggests that ENRON stock has entered ?into a new phase.

The approach employed in the ag curves suggests that there may be some fundamental information related to supply and demand that impacts also drives future price.  A portion of the mean reversion process is actually captured with inclusion of lagged prices  (autoregressive component).  A GBM process requires some information on price volatility.  Since there is presumably no forward/future curve for the commodity of interest, it is difficult to come up with historical volatility values.  Hope it helps.Nelson  From:	Christian LeBroc/ENRON@enronXgate on 04/12/2001 11:46 AMTo:	Nelson Neale/NA/Enron@Enroncc:	 Subject:	Petrochemical Forward CurvesNeslon,I would like to insert ""mean reversion"" and ""geometric brownian motion"" in the linear forward curve equation you put together for me earlier this week.
