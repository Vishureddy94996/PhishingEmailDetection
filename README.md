<h2>The breif description of model is listed below:</h2>
<ul>
<li>Generate word-based features by analyzing frequently appearing words of email’s subjects and contents.</li>
<li>Generate link-based features by examining the URL links embedded in an email.</li>
<li>Generate the readability-based features using eight well-known readability algorithms and applying them to discriminate the text contents of phishing emails and legitimate emails.</li>
<li>Verify the best features set by comparing with other feature selection algorithms on the basis of time, accu- racy and number of features.</li>
<li>Justify the method by comparing the results with the existing approaches.</li>
  </ul>
